##Machine Learning Algorithms

These are programming assignments from my Machine Learning course, with an emphasis on statistical methods. In our assignments, we implement crucial Machine Learning algorithms. I use the SciPy python stack for my assignments.

- PA1: Test/Train data split
- PA2: K Nearest Neighbors
- PA3: Householder's technique for Linear Regression
- PA4: K Means
- PA5: Naive Bayes
