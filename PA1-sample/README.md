This program takes the data set data/abalone.data and will sample
the dataset to get a 10% test set. Then it will run the sample function
10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 times and will plot the mean and Standard Deviation
for the counts of the chosen indices in the array.

NOTE: The program takes ~8 minutes to run on my 2.5 GHz intel 5 processor.

How to run:

'''
python sample.py
