This is an implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

I run this on 4 datasets in the data folder, and plot the results in a 
confusion matrix. To see all the results, run this in termal: 

'''
for i in select_k*; do python $i; done
'''

Note: for each python file, a matlab pyplot will show up. You will need to close
it before the next python file can run.
